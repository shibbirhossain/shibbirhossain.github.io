Hello world!!

This is just beginning. I will add posts related to various technical stuffs.

For now just a simple hello world code snippet:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Shibbir')
#=> prints 'Hi, Shibbir' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out my [LinkedIn ][linkedin-profile] profile for now.
