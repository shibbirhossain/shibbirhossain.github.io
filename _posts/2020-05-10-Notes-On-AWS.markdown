### IAM
* SAML(Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0)  
    Enables users to access AWS resources with their corporate credentials. _Ex:_ Active Directory
* It is recommended to have 1 IAM role per application

### EC2
* EBS - Elastic block store, virtual drive
* ELB - distributing load accross
* ASG - Scaling the services  

subnet - which AZ  
tags - Name (going to show in UI)  
EC2 connect - ssh from browser (AMI linux 2 only)  
pem file permission - 0644 -> too open  
> chmod 0400 *.pem  

### Load Balancers
* HTTPS (SSL termination)
* Enforce stickiness with cookies  

Three diff kinds of LB offerings:
1. Classic Load Balancer 
2. Application Load Balancer - HTTP/HTTPS (L7)
3. Network Load Balancer - TCP (L4)  

To get the actual IP 
> x-forwarded-for (contains the actual IP)

### ASG
* Min Size
* Actual Size / Desired Capacity
* Max Size  

Send Custom Metric via --> PutMetric API  
> ASG <- -triggered by- - cloudWatch  

ASG uses Launch Configuration

### EBS Volume 
Network drive (not physical drive),attach to AZ, EBS encryption  
In flight and at rest encryption  
Snapshots are also encrypted

## Route 53
* A - URL to IPV4
* AAAA - URL to IPV6
* CNAME - URL to URL 
* ALIAS - URL to AWS Resources

## RDS 
* Encryption at rest - KMS - **AES-256**
* Encryption in flight - **SSL**
    * postgres - rds.force_ssl = 1
    * MySQL - REQUIRE SSL

## ElastiCache
Redis/Memcached
* make application stateless by storing state in a common cache
* Write scaling - Sharding
* Read scaling - Read replicas
* multi AZ with failover
* cache hit / cache miss
* cache invalidation strategy  
    
#### Redis     
1. in memory **Key-value**
2. super low latency (sub micro sec)
3. cache survive reboots by default (persistence)
4. great to host -   
                i) user sessions  
                ii) Leaderboard  
                iii) distributed states  
                iv) relieve pressure on db  
                v) pub/sub messaging  

#### Memcached
1. in memory **object** store
2. cache doesn't survive reboots

#### Elasticache Patterns
1. Lazy loading  
    Pros:  
    * only requested data is cached
        
    Cons:
    * cache miss penalty  
    * Stale data - to avoid this use Write-Through and TTL strategy  

2. Write through  
    Pros:  
    * cache is never stale
    * write penalty as oppose to read penalty: users are more tolerant when uploading data

    Cons:
    * cache churn : waste of resource, most data is never read.  


### S3 Versioning
best practice is to enable versioning
* protect against unintended delete
* easy rollback to prev version

### S3 Encryption
1. SSE-S3 - managed by AWS S3
2. SSE-KMS - managed by AWS KMS
3. SSE-C - you want to manage your own encryption key (BYO encryprion Key ðŸ˜‚)
4. Client Side encryption

#### SSE-S3
AWS S3 manages, object encrypted server side  
AES-256 encryption type  
Must set Header:   
> "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES-256"  

#### SSE-KMS
managed by AWS KMS  
Pro:
* user control + audit trail (key rotation)

Server side enc
Header:  
> "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms" 

Key -  KMS Customer Master Key (CMK)

#### SSE-C
* fully managed by customer outside of AWS
* S3 does not store the encryption key
* must use HTTPS
* encryption key must be provided in HTTP header
* Key - Client side data key

#### Client Side encryption
* Client library such as S3 Encryption Client
* Client must encrypt the data themselves before sending to S3
* Client must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
* Customer manages key + encryption cycle

#### Encryption in Transit(SSL/TLS) - In flight
* SSE-C in HTTPS is must
* SSL/TLS

### S3 Security
* IAM Policies
* Bucket Policies - json based policy
    * Resources
    * Action
    * Effect: Allow/Deny
    * Principle: user/acc to apply policy to
* policy can be used to 
    * grant publlic access to bucket
    * force objects to be encrypted at upload
    * grant access to another acc(cross account)
* Networking - VPC endpoints
* logging and audit
    * S3 access logs in other S3 bucket (best practice is to not put on the same one)
    * API calls can be logged via cloudtrail
* User security
    * MFA - versioned buckets 
    * signed url: limited time access (premium video)

### S3 CORS
* Cross origin resource sharing
> Access-Control-Allow-Origin : domain

### S3 Consistency Model
* Read after write
    > PUT 200 > GET 200
* Eventually consistent
    > * GET 404 > PUT 200 > GET 404 (results may be cached)
    > * PUT 200 v1 > PUT 200 v2 > GET 200 v1 (might be older object) 
    > * DELETE 200 > GET 200 (might get the object even after delete for a shortwhile)

### S3 Performance
For each prefix  
* 3500 TPS PUT
* 5500 TPS GET

For faster upload of objects(>=100MB) use multipart upload  
S3 transfer accellaration(uses edge locations)  
SSE-KMS encryption limited to your AWS limits for KMS usage (~100s-1000) downloads/upload per sec

#### S3 and Glacier Select

## AWS CLI
   > aws sts decode-authorization-message --encode-message "message"

## EC2 instance metadata
* 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
* Metadata = data about EC2 instance
* Userdata = launch script of EC2 instance

## AWS SDK
if region not chosen request goes to **us-east-1** by default from SDK

#### Exponential Backoff
1. -> 1s
2. --> 2s
3. ----> 4s 
4. --------> 8s
5. ----------------> 16s

## EBS
Three architecture model:
1. Single instance deployment: dev
2. LB + ASG: production web apps
3. ASG only: non-web apps in prod

ElasticBeanstalk consists of 3 components:
1. Application
2. Application Version
3. Environment name (dev, test, prod)

### EBS deployment modes
1. All at once - fastest deployment, but downtime
2. Rolling - update few at a time, move to new once once first one is healthy, takes down instances, capacity goes down
3. Rolling with batches - spins new instances instead of taking down existing ones, always work full capacity
4. Immutable - spins new instance in new ASG, swaps all instances when everything is healthy. Quick roll back, longest deployment time.

#### ElasticBeanstalk Extensions
* .ebextensions directory
* .config extension(Ex. logging.config)

### Few more EB stuff
* package dependencies with source code to imporve deployment performance 
* HTTPS securelistener - alb.config -> to upload SSL, security group(sg) allow 443
